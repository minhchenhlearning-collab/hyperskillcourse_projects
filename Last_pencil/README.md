This is Last pencil game, which is a game involves 2 players playing turn by turn, taking less than 4 pencils per turn until there is no pencil left. The last to take the pencils will lose
This project involves:
1/ Error Checking:
1.1/ Base number of pencils must be numeric and positive
1.2/ Choosing first to move must be either Jack or John
1.3/ The number of pencils that are taken must be numeric and positive and less than 4
2/ Player turn: John will be the name of player (which means if Jack is chosen to take turn first, the bot will go first) 
3/ Bot turn: Jack is the name of the bot. The bot has a specific pattern to choose the number of pencils to remove
