Overall, this project is about making domino game, this is my third project and it's the hardest so far but not that much and pretty interesting
This project mainly involves:
1/ Splitting pieces. If none of computer hand or player hand has any double pieces, split again.
2/ The highest double will be first to be played. If it's player's then the first turn is computer and vice versa
3/ Player move: command has to in range of length of player hand, if it's negative, insert to the left of the domino snake, right if it's positive, if no possible move, draw piece from stock, if stock empty, skip turn
4/ Computer move: Computing the point for possible moves and pick the lowest one, if no possible move, draw piece from stock, if stock empty, skip turn
5/ Game end when player or computer has no more pieces, and that will also be the winner
6/ Game draw when the last number of the last piece of domino_snake appear 8 times in the whole domino_snake
