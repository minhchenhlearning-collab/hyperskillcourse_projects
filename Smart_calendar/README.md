This project is actually, a reminder which you can add notes and see the remaining time till that events.
This project involves:
1/ Add function:
1.1> Add note or birthday to data.txt file (I store in json format but txt tail bc of the requirement) and calculate the remaining time then print
2/ View function:
1.1> View all/ birthdays/ notes
1.2> View by date (the date events happen)
1.3> View by text (case-insensitive)
1.4> View by order (ascending or descending)
3/ Delete function
3.1> Show all notes stored in file
3.2> Let user decide which to delete by prompting for a list of numbers
3.3> Delete them
NOTE: You have to check for all input errors including type note or also date format etc. 
NOTE: You have to work with data.txt, which means if u add, add to the file, delete, rewrite the file without data chosen to be deleted and data.txt can have data before (that's also the purpose of storing data for continuous use)
