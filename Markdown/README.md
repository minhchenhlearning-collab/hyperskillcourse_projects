This project is mainly like a practice to get used to markdown - a Markup Language to style text
This project involves:
1/ Basic formats : bold, plain, in-line, italic
2/ Header 
3/ Link
4/ New line
5/ List : ordered and unordered list
-> The program will prompt user for format and text, then combine it to a variable to output everytime with chosen format that is apllied to text. Once users input "!done" a file named "output.md" will be created which saves the final passage that is appended over time, if the file already exists, overwrite it
