# hyperskillcourse_projects
These are my Hyperskill's projects that I have done since started learning python (Hyperskill is a python course).
Most of them strictly follow the requirements of Hyperskill.
Some of them can not be guaranteed to qualify because several problems require using Pycharm (I love VSCode) However those requiring I do check and get the result 100% the same as the examples
*Update: Some latter projects can be guaranteed as I downloaded Pycharm (I use VSCode then C-P to Pycharm for testing #ILoveVSCode)
The solutions that I upload is for the final stage (involving previous stages already).
Warn: The changes that i made is just for editing position of file or add README file but not any valueable changes (Because I made this since I havent really understand what is Git T_T)
Hope this help if you're taking Hyperskill course
