This project is drawing Xmas tree but not a simple one, instead, put in on a card and allow user draw as many tree as they want.
This project involves:
1/ Creating empty card (which can be replaced by trees later)
2/ Creating normal tree (with star, sharp top and also a trunk)
3/ Add decorations on the tree (using interval to add decorations as expected)
4/ Put trees on the created card at the place that is decided by user for each tree, later trees input will overlap others
Warn: I am not sure if my solution qualify Hyperskill's requirements as i dont use Pycharm to check (I love VSCode :>). Also, i see no requirements also checking error for user inputs so basically, it is assumed that the inputs are also length to or multiply of 4 (height, interval, column, line). And because i dont check it on the platform so i decided to randomly add more snow falls to make the card more brilliant :)
