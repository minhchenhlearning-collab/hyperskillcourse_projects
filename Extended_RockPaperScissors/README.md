Overall, this problem is about making extended version of RPS, the options can be arbitrary
Specifically:
1/ If user inputs options (anything they want, not only rock paper and scissors), perform extended mode
2/ If user inputs nothing (enter) play normal mode
3/ Add a .txt file to store player score, read to take initial rating and update later
This is useful to recall how to interact with files and slicing lists
