This problem is about exchanging one currency to another by looking up from the Internet
Overall, it's not tough but interesting when I have a chance to first time trying to retrieve data from the Internet
Steps
1/ Prompting for source currency
2/ Sending request to the website to get data
3/ Parsing json by using .json()
4/ Populating the cache dictionary by default with 2 common currencies including USD and EUR
5/ Prompting for the currency to convert to and the amount
6/ If it is in the cache, take it to the do calculation, then you dont have to look up to the Internet. Otherwise, do it and save it to cache for later use
7/ Finally, repeat the process from step 5 until users input nothing
I am not sure if my solution qualify the standard of Hyperskill, but i have tried all examples and my code outputs the same. Because I dont wanna download Jettbrain IDE so i cant submit my solution ( I stick with VSCode T_T )
