This problem is about looking for exchange_rate of the input currency from the Internet.
Overall, it's not tough but interesting when I have a chance to first time trying to retrieve data from the Internet
The data is json format so:
1/ Sending request to the website to get data
2/ Parsing json by using .json()
3/ Finally, you can treat it like a normal dictionary and getting USD and EUR dict
