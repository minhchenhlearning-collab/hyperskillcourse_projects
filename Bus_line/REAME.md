This project is overall about cheking bus line errors and stops.
This project involves:
1/ Checking error for data type, required fields, pattern and if time for lines of stops makes sense (should be increasing)
2/ Check number of stops for each bus id
3/ Check stops, including: finish, start and on_demand stops.
3.1> Every bus id must have at least 1 start stop and 1 finish stop. Otherwise, print a message and stop the code
There are 2 images providing information, which necessary to solve this problem
